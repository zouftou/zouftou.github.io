                    <h2>What is DevOps ?</h2>
                    <p>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases
                        an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.
                        It aimed at unifying software development (dev) and computer infrastructure management (ops),
                        including system administration.</p>
                    <h2>DevOps Stages</h2>
                    <p>The DevOps lifecyle stretches from the beginning of software development through to delivery,
                        maintenance, and security.</p>
                    <p><img src="../../images/devops-stages.png" alt="DevOps Stages" width="100%" height="50%"></p>
                    <p>The stages of the DevOps lifecycle are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Plan</strong>: Organize the work that needs to be done, prioritize it, and track its
                            completion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create</strong>: Write, design, develop and securely manage code and project data
                            with your team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify</strong>: Ensure that your code works correctly and adheres to your quality
                            standards —
                            ideally with automated testing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Package</strong>: Package your applications and dependencies, manage containers, and
                            build artifacts.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Release</strong>: Deploy the software to end users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Configure</strong>: Manage and configure the infrastructure required to support your
                            applications.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor</strong>: Track performance metrics and errors to help reduce the severity
                            and frequency of
                            incidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure</strong>: Check for vulnerabilities through static and dynamic tests, fuzz
                            testing, and
                            dependency scanning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Govern</strong>: Manage security vulnerabilities, policies, and compliance across
                            your organization.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                                    <p><strong>Speed</strong>: Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers
                                        faster, adapt to changing
                                        markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. The DevOps

                                        enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results.
                                        For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of
                                        services
                                        and then release updates to them quicker.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Rapid Delivery</strong>: Increase the frequency and pace of releases so
                                        you can innovate and improve your
                                        product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the
                                        faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage.
                                        Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the
                                        software release process, from build to deploy.</p>

                                        infrastructure changes so you can
                                        reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience
                                        for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery
                                        to test that each change is functional and safe. Monitoring and logging
                                        practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.</p>

                                        Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems
                                        efficiently and with reduced risk. For example, infrastructure as code helps you
                                        manage your development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable
                                        and more efficient manner.</p>

                                        such as ownership and accountability. Developers and operations teams
                                        collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows.
                                        This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods
                                        between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the

                                        policies, fine-grained controls, and configuration management techniques. For
                                        example, using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and

                                        automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of continuous integration are
                                        to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time

                                        development practice where code changes are
                                        automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It
                                        expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing
                                        environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When
                                        continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a
                                        deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test

                                        (API). Microservices are built around business capabilities; each service is
                                        scoped to a single purpose. You can use different frameworks or programming
                                        languages to write microservices and deploy them independently, as a single
                                        service, or as a group of services.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>: Infrastructure as code is a practice in
                                        which infrastructure is provisioned and
                                        managed using code and software development techniques, such as version control
                                        and continuous integration. The cloud’s API-driven model enables developers and
                                        system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically, and at
                                        scale, instead of needing to manually set up and configure resources. Thus,
                                        engineers can interface with infrastructure using code-based tools and treat
                                        infrastructure in a manner similar to how they treat application code. Because
                                        they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can quickly be deployed
                                        using standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches and versions, or
                                        duplicated in repeatable ways.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Organizations monitor metrics and logs
                                        to see how application and infrastructure
                                        performance impacts the experience of their product’s end user. By capturing,
                                        categorizing, and then analyzing data and logs generated by applications and
                                        infrastructure, organizations understand how changes or updates impact users,
                                        shedding insights into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes. Active
                                        monitoring becomes increasingly important as services must be available 24/7 and
                                        as application and infrastructure update frequency increases. Creating alerts or
                                        performing real-time analysis of this data also helps organizations more
                                        proactively monitor their services.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Communication and Collaboration</strong>: Increased communication and
                                        collaboration in an organization is one of the key
                                        cultural aspects of DevOps. The use of DevOps tooling and automation of the
                                        software delivery process establishes collaboration by physically bringing
                                        together the workflows and responsibilities of development and operations.
                                        Building on top of that, these teams set strong cultural norms around
                                        information sharing and facilitating communication through the use of chat
                                        applications, issue or project tracking systems, and wikis. This helps speed up
                                        communication across developers, operations, and even other teams like marketing
                                        or sales, allowing all parts of the organization to align more closely on goals
                                        and projects.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>DevOps has proven to be a transformative approach for organizations aiming to
                        bridge the gap between development and operations, fostering a culture of collaboration,
                        continuous improvement, and automation. By embracing DevOps practices, teams can accelerate
                        their delivery cycles, improve software quality, and enhance scalability and reliability,
                        ultimately driving faster, more reliable innovation. The adoption of continuous integration,
                        continuous delivery, automated testing, and proactive monitoring empowers organizations to
                        respond quickly to market demands and maintain a competitive edge.</p>
